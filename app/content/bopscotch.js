	markdown: "<p>Bopscotch is a tweak on the classic hopscotch game. Each square of the court is associated with a specific tone, allowing a player to create a melody, or team up with others to compose complex melodies, as they hop over the court. By layering tones onto hopscotch, sound is mapped on top of space which strengthens connections between spatial and aural awareness.</p>\n\n<iframe src='//player.vimeo.com/video/65671335' width='600' height='338' frameborder='0' webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n<p>Bopscotch was made for the OTHER Festival at the MIT Media Lab in Spring 2013 by <a href='http://hidenise.com/' target='blank'>Denise Cheng</a>, <a href='http://shaunsalzberg.com/' target='blank'>Shaun Salzberg</a>, and myself.</p>",
