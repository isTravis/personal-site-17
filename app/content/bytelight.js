		<p>ByteLight Inc., a Cambridge-area startup, spun out of the Boston University NSF Smart Lighting Engineering Research Center. With expertise in LED-based visible light communication, ByteLight seeks to change the way we use lighting. Energy efficient LED bulbs and lamps provide an opportunity to send wireless data through the visible spectrum itself. Light based communications offers unique advantages over radio based technologies by delivering higher aggregate bandwidth, directional security, and accurate 3D indoor positioning capabilities.</p>
