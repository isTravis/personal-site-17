		<p>An animated gif is a magical thing. It contains the power to convey emotion, empathy, and context in a subtle way that text or emoticons simply can't.</p>
		<p>GIFGIF is a project to capture that magic with quantitative methods. Our goal is to create a tool that lets people explore the world of gifs by the emotions they evoke, rather than by manually entered tags.</p>

		<p>The project owes much inspiration to the <a target='blank' href='http://pulse.media.mit.edu'>Place Pulse</a> project and its team.</p>
		<img src='/images/project_pics/gifgif_00.png' />
		<p>GIFGIF has been lovingly written by Travis Rich and Kevin Hu with much support from the grad students and faculty in the <a target='_blank' href='http://viral.media.mit.edu'>Viral Spaces</a> and <a target='_blank' href='http://macro.media.mit.edu'>Macro Connections</a> research groups. </p>
		<p>GIFGIF is built in hopes of answering some really interesting questions. Does a gif's emotional variance impact how it's received? (We have a hunch that emotional variance is why :) is pretty acceptable but ;) is typically an awkward mix of creepy/sexy/playful/pirate-y). Does a gif's emotional content vary between cultures? For example, what is the best representation of happiness for Germans, compared to a Canadian's impression?</p>

		<p>We build this project with the caveat that emotions are tricky - and by no means a trivial (or even possible) thing to quantify. We seek to use emoticons that represent a 'core' or 'basic' emotion so we can understand the atomistic elements of what a gif is conveying. For such a complex goal, we defer to the breadth of research and career-long effort of <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Ekman' target='_blank'>Paul Ekman</a>. In some of his earlier work he found six emotions to be universal and basic: anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and surprise. In the 90s, he expanded this selection of universal emotions to include the 17 you find right here on GIFGIF.</p>
		<p>These are by no means definitive, correct, or absolute, but our goal is to make a gif website - not solve the open questions of universal human emotions.
