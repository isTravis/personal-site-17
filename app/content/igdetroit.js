		<h4 id='mission'>The Mission</h4>
		<p>As part of the 2012 MIT Media Lab Innovators Guild, I travelled to Detroit to join a team of researchers. Our focus was on lighting around the city. Our first meeting began by explicitly detailing that this was going to be a different kind of challenge. Advisors made it clear that we weren't going to fix anything - we likely weren't going to prototype anything substantial. Those who had already spent some time in Detroit assured us that the challenges that exist in Detroit are not the kind that can be solved in a weekend hackathon. The charge given to us was to develop relationships. To meet local Detroiters, listen to their stories and interpretation of the challenges that exist, and to begin to develop trust. </p>
		<p>The entire Media Lab group was split into five different challenges. The challenge I was placed in was Lighting. Detroit has 80,000 public street lights - 40,000 of which don't work. Many residents have complained that the darkness is a problem that leads to a host of other serious issues. My team was comprised of Valentin Heun (MIT Media Lab), Jeff Chapin (IDEO), David A. Smith (Lockheed Martin), Jeff Sturges (OmniCorp Detroit), and Jim Young (Xunlight). There was a strong mix of engineers, designers, and varying professional experiences.</p>
		<p>The onset problem statement given to us (which was left intentionally vague) was to explore possible paths for improving the street lighting conditions in Detroit. We were encouraged to tweak this statement over the course of the trip. </p>

		<h4 id='intro'>The Mindset Going In:</h4>
		<p>As we would soon find out from our first interactions with Detroiters, outsiders - or aliens as a few people called them - were actually a problem. People who would come to Detroit with the idea that their power, money, and influence could 'fix' Detroit. They'd usually be there for a few days and then be gone, never to be seen again - with the newfound ability of claiming that they've been to Detroit as though it were a badge of honor. These alien trips don't accomplish anything and have developed a knee-jerk reaction among many Detroit citizens to distrust outsiders. This trip was all about developing trust and showing the local people that the Lab was sincere in their commitment to make our effort more than a quick weekend 'badge of honor'. </p>

		<p>Arriving on the first day we were shuttled to our hotel in the heart of downtown Detroit. Despite the feeling of a regular downtown financial district, the number of vacant buildings and lack of people was striking. Someone gave the figure that Detroit proper was designed for 2.5 million people and the current population was only around 700,000. </p>

		<h4 id='day1'>First Day:</h4>
		<p>Our first day consisted mostly of wandering around the city and getting a feel for a few of the neighborhoods (Our plane landed around 1:00pm). We met up with several people at OmniCorp Detroit that gave us further tours of the city. One of my first impressions was that there was an inspiring sense of freedom in the city. You have the opportunity to plot your own course, create your own community, determine your destiny - and often times in ways that violate city laws, but because of the lowered oversight you can get away with it for long enough that it eventually becomes a real part of the community (e.g. taking over local abandoned lots for urban farms). This 'freedom' seems to come with a heightened risk though. The lack of externally enforced infrastructure means more dangerous (feeling) neighborhoods and lots of failure, which though not inherently bad, can lead to tougher times.</p>

		<p>The night ended with a kick-off dinner led by Joi and Colin Raney(IDEO). Here, they outlined the five task areas (Lighting, Soil, Agriculture, Air, and Digital Community) again and gave us an opportunity to meet with several of the local Detroiters to further explore the challenges ahead of us. </p>

		<h4 id='day2'>Second Day:</h4>
		<p>Our second day began by traveling to a community garden where we met Wayne and Myrtle. We pulled up and were surprised to find them with a group of ~20 neighborhood kids. They were all working together to paint a mural for their neighborhood. Though shy at first, they were very open and friendly and open to explaining what they were working on. </p>

		<p>Wayne spoke to us for a bit and conveyed a very deep sense of connection with the land that they were planting on. It was here that I first felt that Detroit had somehow taken a step back (not necessarily in a negative way) to a time when humans had a much stronger relationship with the earth they live on. Detroit began to feel like a series of small tribes (neighborhoods) that had an inspiring sense of self-dependence. It felt like a human society that existed before the time of mass consumerism. The focus is on family, community, self sustenance - but now with the added advantage of the internet, cell phones, and IT. </p>

		<p>Myrtle, his wife, echoed these sentiments. Though with less of a spiritual tone, she also conveyed the idea that the community was the base unit by which Detroit functioned. Block-committees were setup and met frequently to determine efforts, programs, and initiatives that might be valuable for their neighborhoods. She also gave us an important anecdote regarding lighting. The streetlight across from her house had been broken for some time. She had actively petitioned the local government to fix the light for over two years. They finally got around to her request and fixed the light, only to have it be shot out with a BB gun two weeks later. Two years of effort for two weeks of light. This represents the larger problem, which many people detailed, that the local government was either too slow or too disconnected to have any meaningful impact on the lives of the Detroit citizens. </p>
		<p>Later that day we explored the Mt. Elliot MakerSpace - a hackerspace Jeff Sturges has setup in the basement of the Mt. Elliot Church to work with kids and local community members. Jeff made clear his inspiration from Neil Gershenfeld's fab lab movement and compared the MakerSpace to a low-budget fab lab targeted at a younger audience. There we had the fortunate coincidence of bumping into Kevon - one of Jeff Sturges' 17 year old students (currently a senior in High School). He sat with us for several hours, talking about his experiences with the lighting conditions in Detroit. He mentioned that a lot of the time, dogs - rather than humans - were a problem in darker areas. Aggressive dogs have been known to attack people who accidentally stumble too close, often because they hadn't seen the dog in the first place. Damien, another Detroiter that works with Jeff at the MakerSpace also joined us. He had strong ideas about how he could use education and learning as a means of empowering people to fix the problems they experienced in Detroit (rather than working for a top-down fix). Jeff Sturges commented after these discussions that he was shocked by how effective the design-focused approach that was used with Kevon turned out to be. He said that the interaction had a strong effect on him and would influence how he approaches problem-solving with some of the younger kids in the MakerSpace.</p>

		<p>That night, our timing was fortunate enough to coincide with DeLectricity - an art inspired event with a heavy focus on light. There was a bike parade through part of town where hundreds of people gathered to ride through the city. Given it was part of the DeLectricity festivities, people were strongly encouraged (and provided with materials) to outfit their bikes with bright lights and colorful reflector tape. One group, the East Side Riders, said that they themselves run a bike group that tricks out their bikes to be overly bright and flamboyant for the purposes of riding around the neighborhood and acting as deterrents to crime. </p>

		<p>A strong take away message that I took from the first day was that you can't fix a community from the outside. If you want to influence a community, you must either 1) join the community and make a full time commitment, or 2) help in knowledge exchange and let those in the community carry your knowledge to fix their problems. Furthermore, there are a lot of well meaning people outside the community who want to help, but can't - so giving them a channel where they can put their effort is valuable. A local institution (e.g. hackerspace) can develop a relationship within the community and then have outsiders come in and help with the knowledge exchange. This way residents trust the local institution and the aliens are able to contribute knowledge exchange by participating at the hackerspace.</p>
		<h4 id='day3'>Third Day:</h4>
		<p>The third day we spent a lot of time in the morning going over what we had learned from the day before and brainstorming what we could in the time remaining that would be of value. We quickly came to the conclusion that simply building a light would be a wasted effort that didn't live beyond the span of the weekend. We slowly gravitated towards the idea of running a lighting workshop out of the Mt. Elliot MakerSpace. We planned to have a handful of kids build their own lighting devices, with the idea that it would demonstrate that they had the capability of influencing their direct lighting situation. We gathered a bunch of lighting equipment (flashlights, solar panels, electroluminescent panels and wire, lawn lights, and bulbs) and brought it all to the makerspace. </p>

		<p>When we arrived, several kids were already there using the space for their own purposes. We began to unpack the equipment and were attempting to make up a plan of how the workshop would look on the fly. We began deconstructing the flashlights to get access to the LEDs they had inside and before we could finish this step, or come up with a coherent plan for the workshop, the kids gathered around with enthusiasm. They all started asking if they could help. Out of this, the workshop organically grew. The kids took apart the flashlights, had fun seeing how everything connected, and at our suggestion, got excited to rebuild the lights in their own form. We began to show them how to solder together the parts of the flashlight and they quickly picked it up - adapting the form factor of the flashlight to their liking. While there was a clear learning goal in our minds, the kids took it much more as a game, and quickly started building the lights for the purpose of playing laser tag with each other. It was surprising how differently they approached the workshop compared with what we had expected would happen. They were much more engaged and creative than we would have predicted. It was really like our only job was to bring the materials and provide a little amount of guidance - they took care of everything else. </p>

		<p>The last day all the groups presented their work to the rest of the IG members and to a handful of local Detroiters that came to listen. The focus was on recapping the experience with an eye towards how this can move forward. We presented the logistics of what we did, but also some of the stronger take away messages that coalesced by the end of the trip. See the <a href='#presentation'>Presentation</a> section for a link to our slides.</p>

		<h4 id='takeaway'>A Few Take Away Messages</h4>
		<p>The lighting problem, at its core, is really a safety problem. While not having street lights may make a neighborhood look worse, the real issue here is when a lack of lighting leads to dangerous situations. This could be both a matter of being seen (to avoid being hit by cars) and seeing your surroundings (to acknowledge a dangerous situation). What we found was that many of the neighborhoods, being unable to rely on local government to fix the lights, developed a stronger sense of community to combat safety concerns. It seemed like if you can't have a well-lit street, a good backup was a community that feels safe and is there to protect you in times of trouble. Furthermore, we left with the feeling that a big impact can be made by empowering the locals to build their own lighting solutions. Even if they couldn't make something as bright or efficient as what a larger municipal infrastructure could provide, the act of performing a service for the community would serve as a gesture that strengthens the relationships and trust amongst its members. </p>
		<p>We also noticed that there was a interesting difference between public and private space in Detroit. Generally, public spaces contain one set of rules for behavior and private spaces contain enough. In many cities, the rules in a public space are well maintained because of the presence of government law enforcement and infrastructure maintenance. In Detroit, however, the lack of influence of local government and the damaged state many public spaces have fallen into has led to a situation where the rules of behavior in public spaces are less defined. This often has negative side effects - a lowered sense of safety, poorly maintained facilities, etc. As a result, many people in Detroit have tried to reclaim public spaces as their own private spaces. Private spaces which they can maintain and keep safe. A simple way we saw people doing this was by using bright porch lights that throw light well into the street. This combats the lighting issue, but also lays claim, in some sense, to wherever the light reaches. Similarly, people have put lights in trees and other areas of their neighborhood, not for the purpose of lighting, but to claim that space as area that someone cares about - sending a message to people who pass. The Heidelberg project is a fantastic example of this. The Heidelberg project is a multi-block area that was taken over by one person and decorated with huge amounts of artistic pieces. The art, regardless of its artistic value, claims the space as something that is tended and cared for by a local resident - sending the message that the crumbling structures that tend to be prevalent in government controlled areas won't be found there.</p>

		</table>
		<p>Another theme that our team came to was this idea of redefining reality. The reality of life for people living in Detroit is very different than that of many other people in the country. For an outsider, it can be very difficult to fully understand or realize the reality that people in Detroit experience. As such, many of the solutions and products that are made to 'fix' Detroit are made in another reality - a reality that completely neglects many of the subtleties that create issues in Detroit. As such, these solutions fail. Often times though, whether it be from the local government or other outsides, these solutions given to the people of Detroit are all they have. Thus, many people in Detroit are simply presented with a broken reality. Something that doesn't - and can't - work to solve their problems. In many cases, the only way to solve this problem may be to empower the locals to realize that they have the power to shape their own reality - to deconstruct that which is given to them, and to rebuild it in into their own functioning thing that works for their reality. This was something that we saw happening in the workshop as the kids made their own flashlights. The ones given to them were very finished and presented as a final product - a flashlight. But really, it is merely a set of batteries, LEDs, and some connecting wires. By showing this to the kids, they were able to deconstruct the flashlight and build it into their own reality - a game of lasertag. Even though the end product they made was no different in physical functionality than the flashlight they started with - the fact that it had been constructed from their reality, rather than an outside one, made all the difference. Empowering people to realize that that which is presented to them is not a single thing, but rather, a collection of components that can be deconstructed and reconstructed, is a message that we think could have a powerful influence on many people in Detroit.</p>
