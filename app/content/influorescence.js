The responsibility falls too lightly across the shoulders of all users, and no one person feels sufficiently responsible to maintain the resource.</p>\n\t\t\t<p><strong>Solution:</strong> We distill the effects of consumption to a personal level. In this case, your energy consumption directly influences your own personal 'ecosystem'.</p>\n\t\t\t -->\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t<p><strong>The Project:</strong> </p>\n\t\t\t<p>- We take the environment as the shared resource of interest.</br>\n\t\t\t- Individuals' daily energy consumption creates unseen influences on the environment.</br>\n\t\t\t- This unseen influence is too abstract to produce an effective call to action.</br>\n\t\t\t- Our goal is to create an organic form that displays your relationship to your energy use.</br>\n\t\t\t- We explore the relationship between life (the organic form) and consumption.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p><strong>The Interface:</strong> </p>\n\t\t\t<p>A garden will represent the organic form and the brightness of an LED light system will be the energy consumer. Higher energy consumption in the lighting system will lead to a tangible garden display that appears less healthy.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The lights can be directly controlled by a light switch and the garden will react accordingly. Or, the garden can be directly manipulated (groomed or killed) to in turn influence the state of the lighting system.</p>\n\t\t\t<img src='/images/project_pics/infloPic1.png' width='600px' align='center'/>\n\t\t\t<p></p>\n\t\t\t<img src='/images/project_pics/infloPic2.png' width='600px' align='center'/>\n\t\t\t<p></p>\n\t\t\t<img src='/images/project_pics/infloPic3.jpeg' width='600px' align='center'/>\n\t\t\t<p></p>\n\t\t\t<img src='/images/project_pics/infloPic4.jpeg' width='600px' align='center'/>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>influorescence was done in collaboration with <a href='http://www.colorsaregood.com/'>Valentine Heun</a>, <a href='http://slcl.ca'>Stephanie Lin</a>, and <a href='http://shaunsalzberg.com/'>Shaun Salzberg</a> at the <a href='http://media.mit.edu'>MIT Media Lab</a>.</p>",
