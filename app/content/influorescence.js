		<p>influorescence (inflorescence + fluorescence) is a two-way tangible interface for ambient lighting control and power monitoring.</p>

		<p><strong>The Project:</strong></p>
		<ul>
			<li>We take the environment as the shared resource of interest.</li>
			<li>Individuals' daily energy consumption creates unseen influences on the environment.</li>
			<li>This unseen influence is too abstract to produce an effective call to action.</li>
			<li>Our goal is to create an organic form that displays your relationship to your energy use.</li>
			<li>We explore the relationship between life (the organic form) and consumption.</li>
		</ul>
		<p><strong>The Interface:</strong> </p>
		<p>A garden will represent the organic form and the brightness of an LED light system will be the energy consumer. Higher energy consumption in the lighting system will lead to a tangible garden display that appears less healthy.</p>
		<p>The lights can be directly controlled by a light switch and the garden will react accordingly. Or, the garden can be directly manipulated (groomed or killed) to in turn influence the state of the lighting system.</p>
