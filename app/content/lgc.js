		<p>Jack Chick makes some ridiculous comics (ridiculous in the hateful, extremist sense). Conspiracy theorists make ridiculous websites (in the hateful, comic sans sense). So, naturally, we combined the two.</p>
		<p>The overtly ridiculous demon-child is found at <a href='http://lowgradecondoms.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/' target='blank'>this demon url.</a></p>
		<p>LGC comics is a system that randomly generates conspiracy theorist text and inserts it into randomly selected Chick Tract comics. Auto-generated covers and titles complete the package.</p>
		<img src='/images/project_pics/lgc_1.jpg' />
		<p>The project owes a serious debt to <a href='http://www.truthforhumanity.com/'>Truth for Humanity</a>, <a href='http://garfieldminusgarfield.net/'>Garfield Minus Garfield</a>, the Internet, and of course, to Jack Chick, whose work we parody without permission.</p>
		<p>The project was built by Chia Evers, <a href='http://education.mit.edu/people/jason-haas' target='blank'>Jason Haas</a>, <a href='https://twitter.com/novysan' target='blank'>Dan Novy</a>, <a href='http://www.savannahniles.com/' target='blank'>Savannah Niles</a>, and myself.</p>
