		<p>The <a href='http://www.bu.edu/nano' target='blank'>Nanomaterials and Nanostructure Optics Group</a>, led by Luca Dal Negro focuses on exploring subdiffusive transport of photons in aperiodic nanostructure lattices.</p>

		<p>My work was inspired by the recent excitement in the photonic community regarding anomalous transport of light through engineered materials. This enthusiasm has focused largely on superdiffusion while the realm of subdiffusion has been left largely unexplored. Recognizing this void in understanding, my thesis provides some of the first study into the domain of subdiffusive transport in deterministic photonic systems. Such a phenomenon is of great interest to the development of advanced thin-film solar cells and optical sensing technologies which depend heavily on multiple scattering phenomena and the engineering of slow light.</p>
