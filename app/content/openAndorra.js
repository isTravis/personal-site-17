		<p>Beginning in May 2013, I joined the Government of Andorra and became the Director of Technology for their Smart Country program. The program is seeking to revitalize the countries economy by introducing new technologies and infrastructure. </p>
		<p>From the Government, the Smart Country program is championed by the Secretary of State for Economic Diversification, Josep Maria Miss\u00e9 and Minister of Foreign Affairs, Gilbert Saboya Suny\u00e9. I have been brought in to lead the development of the 1, 2, and 5-year strategic and technical planning of the project, as well as to serve as the bridge between the telco, energy company, local startups, and international agencies in support of the program.</p>

		<p>If Andorra is anything, it's small. They have a single government-owned telecom company, a single government-owned energy utility provider, and a 1km strip of road through which 90% of the 8,000,000 annual tourists pass. With this small size, concentrated technology sector, and agile government, Andorra is seeking to launch the world\u2019s first fully-connected, fully-integrated Smart Country program.</p>
