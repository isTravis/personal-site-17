		<p>Shubble is your sharing bubble. The project aims to remove the disparity between human-to-human knowledge sharing and computer-to-computer knowledge sharing. The project seeks to leverage the same proximity-based privileging that humans employ in daily conversation. Face to face conversation leverages the shared physical location of its members, whereas digital conversation leverages cloud-based permissioning (accounts, passwords, etc). By creating a shared digital space based on device location, we create a seamless way to share digital les with those in your meeting space. The project identifies mobile devices in a common space and creates a shared repository between the owners of those devices.</p>

		<p>The project uses a knocking signal to identify proximal devices and to initiate a shared data space. Shubble creates a persistent shared space for users to continue and enhance their conversation, wrapping around existing cloud services such as Google Docs or Dropbox.</p>
