		<p>The Boston University Smart Lighting Center, led by Professor Thomas Little, is an effort to leverage the unique properties of solid state lighting to create intelligent lighting systems. The project strives to embed communications technology into general purpose lighting - providing data connectivity wherever there is man-made light.</p>

		<p>By merging the energy efficiency of LEDs, the ubiquity of indoor lighting, and the capability of freespace-optical communication we have the opportunity to offer a transformative paradigm capable of providing energy-efficient lighting and ubiquitous data connectivity.</p>

		<p>Spinning from the center, the Smart Travel project was created. The goal of the smart travel project is to make cars talk! A growing number of auto manufacturers seek to embed location awareness systems (lane detection, blind spot detection, etc) into their vehicles. While this provides a means of observation, there is not yet a platform for collaboration or communication between vehicles; the smart travel project seeks to provide this foundation.\t</p>
