		<p>The Mirai Hackathon was hosted at the MIT Media Lab at the beginning of Fall 2013. Bringing artists from Japan, Media Lab students, and industry designers together, we built. Working with Daito Manabe, exploring the future of entertainment, we developed the game Twitch.</p>

		<p>Twitch is a twist on the classic jumping platformer game. Rather than a single person experience, the game tightly couples two people into a cooperative play. One player uses and mouses to jump from platform to platform. This player makes requests for where they wish for a platform to appear. These requests generate electric shocks on the fingers of player two. Each finger corresponds to an associated button. Pressing the button corresponding to the shocked finger generates the platform and allows the first player to stay alive. Death, by missing a platform or hitting a monster, results in shocks to the second players face.</p>
		<p>The electrodes used to shock Player 2's face are precisly placed so as to trigger the fine muscles located around their face, resulting in electrically stimulated facial expressions. Face tracking and an EEG sensor are used to determine the focus and smile of player 2 and dictates the speed of the game scrolling.</p>
